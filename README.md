# Signalroom

Signalroom is a small, self-hosted observability and incident-response workbench written in Go. It accepts structured events, keeps a deterministic timeline, persists accepted batches to disk, and offers a product demo suitable for local verification. No external services are required.

## Requirements

- Go 1.26 or newer

## Demo

```bash
go run ./cmd/signalroom demo
```

## HTTP server

```bash
go run ./cmd/signalroom serve --addr 127.0.0.1:8080 --data ./data
```

- `--addr` is the listen address (default `:8080`).
- `--data` is the directory used for durable event data. It is created if
  missing. Only one running `serve` instance may use a given data directory;
  a second instance exits with a non-zero status and leaves the data
  untouched. Restarting after a normal exit or a killed process is allowed.

Accepted batches are fsynced before the success response, so every confirmed
event survives a restart or a process crash. Only an incomplete final write
(torn tail after a crash) is discarded; any other corruption makes startup
fail with a non-zero status without modifying the data.

Besides the event log, the data directory holds `cursor.key`, a random
per-directory secret created on first start that signs `GET /events/page`
cursors. It is never transmitted and is what makes a cursor from one data
directory invalid in another; deleting it invalidates outstanding cursors
but leaves the events untouched.

### POST /events

Submit a batch. The body must be a JSON object containing exactly an `events`
array. Each event uses the fields `id`, `service`, `severity`, `message` and
`at`, plus an optional `labels` object; `at` is an RFC3339Nano timestamp.
Unknown fields are rejected. String fields are trimmed and `severity` is
lowercased; `id`, `service`, `message` and `at` are required.

`labels` is a JSON object of string to string (for example
`{"env":"prod","region":"cn-north-1","version":"v2"}`). Omitting it, `null`,
and `{}` all mean "no labels". Names and values are trimmed of surrounding
whitespace, keep their case, and must be non-empty afterwards; an event may
carry at most 32 labels, with names up to 64 and values up to 256 Unicode
code points. Non-string values, duplicate JSON keys, names that collide after
trimming, and anything past these limits are rejected with `400`.

Labels are part of the event's content: a retry with the same id must carry
the same labels (order and surrounding whitespace are irrelevant), otherwise
it is a `409` conflict.

The whole batch is accepted or rejected together, with input validation
taking precedence over conflict checks:

- `200` — `{"created": <n>, "replayed": <m>}`, where `created` counts newly
  stored events and `replayed` counts retries identical to a stored event.
- `400` — invalid JSON, unknown fields, an empty array, or an event failing
  validation. Nothing from the batch is written.
- `409` — an id already stored with different content, or an id repeated
  within the batch. Nothing is changed.
- `503` — storage has failed; this and later requests fail until restart.

Time equality uses absolute instants, so the same moment in different
timezone offsets is treated as identical.

```bash
curl -sS -X POST localhost:8080/events \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"events":[{"id":"evt-1","service":"gateway","severity":"CRITICAL","message":"error rate spike","at":"2026-10-01T10:00:00.123456789+08:00","labels":{"env":"prod","version":"v2"}}]}'
```

Re-sending the identical body returns `{"created":0,"replayed":1}`.

### GET /events

Return the stored events as a JSON array ordered by time then id; an empty
result is `[]`. Events with labels include the full stored `labels` object;
events without labels omit the field. Optional query parameters:

- `service` — exact match after trimming.
- `severity` — case-insensitive match after trimming.
- `since`, `until` — RFC3339Nano instants, both ends inclusive. A missing end
  is unbounded. An inverted range or an unparsable timestamp yields `400`.
- `label` — repeatable, up to 32 conditions, each `label=name=value`. The
  first `=` splits name from value (later equals signs belong to the value);
  both follow the ingestion trimming and limit rules. Every condition must
  match, events missing the label never match, and comparison is
  case-sensitive. Empty conditions, a missing `=`, invalid names or values,
  and conditions that collide after trimming all yield `400`.

```bash
curl -sS 'localhost:8080/events?service=gateway&severity=critical&label=env=prod&label=version=v2&since=2026-10-01T00:00:00Z&until=2026-10-02T00:00:00Z'
```

### GET /events/page

Page through a stable, cursor-based view of the events without building the
whole array. The first page accepts the same `service`, `severity`,
`since`/`until`, and repeatable `label` filters as `GET /events`, with the
same trimming, casing, inclusive-end, and label rules. `limit` bounds one
page: it is a single decimal integer from `1` to `1000` and defaults to
`100` when omitted; a missing, duplicated, empty, non-decimal, or out-of-range
`limit` is a `400`.

`200` returns `{"events":[...], "next_cursor": ...}`. The events are ordered
by time then id and carry their full `labels` object (the field is omitted
for label-less events); an empty match is `"events":[]`. `next_cursor` is an
opaque string while more records remain and `null` on the final page.

The first page fixes the set of events that were fully committed at that
instant and matched the filters; every later page reads from that same
frozen set. Events ingested while a walk is in progress — even events with an
earlier timestamp, events inside the filter window, or events sharing a
timestamp with a matched one — never appear in that walk, and an identical
re-ingestion does not change it either; start a new first-page request to see
them. A batch committed concurrently with the first page is either wholly in
the frozen set or wholly out of it. Walking to a `null` cursor yields every
matching record exactly once.

Continue with `cursor=<next_cursor>`; the cursor may be reused any number of
times by any number of clients, and repeating the same cursor and limit
returns the same page and the same next cursor — paging never consumes
progress. `limit` may change between pages; reading resumes from the same
position.

A continuation normally carries no filter parameters and reuses the first
page's filters. If *any* filter is present, the complete normalized filter
set must be restated and match the first page's; reordering label
conditions, trimming-allowed whitespace, changing severity letter case, or
expressing the same instant in another time zone all count as identical.
Any mismatch — including a partial restatement or a changed single condition
— is a `400`.

Cursors are bound to the data directory with a server-held secret. They keep
working across a normal restart or a killed process, never expose writes that
arrived after the set was frozen, and are rejected (`400`) by any other data
directory. Empty, duplicated, unparseable, out-of-range, or tampered cursors
all return `400` with a non-empty `error`; a request never silently starts a
new query. As with the other endpoints, poisoned storage returns `503`.

```bash
curl -sS 'localhost:8080/events/page?service=gateway&limit=100'
# {"events":[...],"next_cursor":"eyJ2IjoxLi4ufQ.<signature>"}
curl -sS 'localhost:8080/events/page?cursor=eyJ2IjoxLi4ufQ.<signature>&limit=100'
```

### GET /events/compare

Compare event volume between a baseline window and an observation window,
broken into aligned segments. Both windows are half-open (the start is
included, the end is excluded), must each have a start strictly before their
end, and must have exactly equal lengths; they may overlap. All four
timestamps are required RFC3339Nano instants and `step` is a required decimal
integer from `1` to `86400` seconds:

- `baseline_since`, `baseline_until` — the baseline window.
- `since`, `until` — the observation window.
- `step` — segment size in seconds.
- `service`, `severity` — optional, using the same trimming and
  case-insensitive rules as `GET /events`; only matching events are counted.
- `label` — optional and repeatable (up to 32), same `name=value` rules as
  `GET /events`; totals and every segment count only events matching all
  conditions.

Segments start at each window's beginning and advance every `step` seconds;
the final segment ends at the window end even when it is shorter than a full
step. For example, a ten-minute window with `step=240` yields three segments
of 4, 4, and 2 minutes. A window needing more than 10000 segments is rejected
with `400` rather than truncated, and empty windows still return the complete
segment set with zero counts.

`200` returns the totals for both sides, their difference
(`observation_total - baseline_total`), the relative change
(`difference / baseline_total`, a JSON number or `null` when the baseline
total is zero), and the segments ordered from each window's start. Every
segment carries the actual UTC `baseline_since`/`baseline_until` and
`since`/`until` boundaries, both counts, and the per-segment difference.
Timestamps in the response always use UTC RFC3339Nano; comparing is by
absolute instant, so the same moment in another time zone gives identical
results, and nanosecond precision is preserved.

Events in an overlap count once per side but in at most one segment on each
side. The whole response is computed from one committed snapshot, so a batch
written during a request is either fully included or fully absent.

```bash
curl -sS 'localhost:8080/events/compare?baseline_since=2026-10-01T09:00:00Z&baseline_until=2026-10-01T09:10:00Z&since=2026-10-01T10:00:00Z&until=2026-10-01T10:10:00Z&step=240'
```

Missing, duplicated, or unparsable parameters, an out-of-range `step`,
inverted or unequal-length windows, and the 10000-segment limit all return
`400` with a non-empty `error`. As with the other endpoints, a poisoned store
returns `503`.

All error responses are JSON objects with a non-empty `error` string, e.g.
`{"error":"event id already exists with different content"}`.
